              Image localization aims to accurately identify and locate specified objects within an image, making it a key problem in computer vision. Traditional localization systems rely heavily on intermediary modalities like textual descriptions, speech, or visual cues to interpret human intent. However, these modalities only serve as indirect representations of human consciousness, limiting the efficiency of information transmissionâ€”especially when detailed descriptions of textures and spatial locations are required, which can be costly and time-consuming. Existing EEG-based localization systems, while offering the potential to directly interpret human thoughts, still fall short of traditional text-based systems in terms of accuracy. Additionally, the high cost of data collection, small pool of subjects, and vast differences in individual cognitive processes make it difficult to train subject-independent models, which has hindered the development of EEG technology for localization tasks. To address these challenges, we present MindLoc, a lightweight, subject-independent EEG-based localization model. MindLoc can quickly and accurately locate the object a user is thinking about in a visual image by interpreting their brainwave signals. It combines the accuracy of traditional text-based systems with the speed and convenience of EEG-based localization. Furthermore, we are the first to introduce encryption technology to protect EEG data privacy, alleviating user concerns and paving the way for a more diverse subject pool in future research. Experimental results demonstrate that MindLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in EEG-based localization tasks, offering significant advantages in both accuracy and convenience.            </p>
